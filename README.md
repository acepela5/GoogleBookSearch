# GoogleBookSearch

## Overview
Are you looking for a new book to read? Look no further because the Google Book Search is here to save the day! With Google Book Search, users type a book title or author into the search box and an api is used to render results from GoogleBooks, including title, thumbnail, and description. More information can be found about the book by clicking on the "More Details" link, sendind the user to GooglePlay where they can even purchase the book if they so choose to. If the user wants to save a result for later, a small orange star is placed next to the thumbnail cover and will save the book title on the Saved Books page.
